# Framework-101
This is a repository that I used to learning to write a deep learning framework from scratch! I will try to re-write the **mostly** used deep learning layers and functions in this repository.

Here is what I gonna do:

## TODO List:

Instead of writing the fundamental system of most deep learning frameworks(autograd, datatype.....), I decide to write some common used layers and functions:

*  Linear Layer (Fully Connected Layer)
*  Convolutional Layer (1D, 2D.....)
*  Activation Functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, SiLU....)
*  Pooling Layers

I decide to re-impl these functions first because they are easy to write, and after I finish these functions, we will get back to write the above fundamental systems and we can easily verify them using the written layers.












NOTE: These repository is **not** meant for production use, it's just me practicing my coding techniques. The mostly used package is numpy(i guess).
